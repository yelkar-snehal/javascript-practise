The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently.

efficeiency is mesaured in terms of complexities:

- time complexity: time reqd to execute a program
- space complexity: space taken by program's variables
  - auxilary space complexity: space taken by variables apart from the input params
