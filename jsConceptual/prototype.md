- object with hidden properties attached to your object by JS engine, this object is `__proto__`
- same as global object `protoytpe`
- that is `Array.prototype` is same as `arr.__proto__`
- prtotype chaining array or function or any global object -> object prototype -> null
- this justifies the fact that anything in JS is an object
- inheritance in prototypes: check if field exits on the obj first -> then its proto -> then its proto's proto
- `prototype` same as `__proto__`
