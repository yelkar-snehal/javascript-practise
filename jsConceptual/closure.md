A closure is a function that retains access to its outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created every time a function is defined.

Use Cases:
Data Encapsulation: Create private variables.
Event Handlers: Preserve variables in asynchronous code.
Currying Functions: Create functions with preset arguments.
