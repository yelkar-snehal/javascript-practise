- everything in JS happens inside execution context
- execution context is like a big box containing memory component i.e, variable environment (values and functions); 2nd component is code or thread of exceution (executes code line one at a time)
- js is synchronous single threaded language; i.e, it can only exceute one command at a time
- 2 phases are memory creation and code execution
- during memory creation phase, values for variables are initialised with "undefined" whereas functions are kept as it is
- "undefined" can be considered as a placeholder, a special keyword
- during phase 2, i.e, code exceution, actual values are assigned, fn defns are untouched since there is nothing to exceute till they are actually invoked
- for every function execution, a new context will be created, control would return to the parent context once fn returns something or goes to the end of its line
- upon exit, the child context will be deleted
- once all children context have been deleted, parent or global execution context gets deleted
- all this is managed by the call stack, it gets populated with the global exceution context first and then later further child contexts are pushed and popped
- call stack maintains the order of execution
- call stack also known as control, program, exception stack
